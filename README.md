# Software Navbar Enabler - Magisk Module

This module enables the software navigation bar in Android by adding `qemu.hw.mainkeys=0` to the build.prop in /system/
It does **not** disable the hardware keys of your device.

Should work with every halway up to date Android version, but no guarantee for that (if it doesn't work, it shouldn't break anything either).
Only tested with Magisk v18.0 on OnePlus 5 with the unofficial LineageOS 16.0 (Android 9.0.x) pre-release by @codeworkx
